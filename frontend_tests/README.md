## ðŸ§© Challenges Encountered
---

### 1. Learning React Flow from Scratch  
This was my first time working with React Flow, which has a unique mental model around nodes, edges, and custom components. I overcame this by:
- Studying the [React Flow documentation](https://reactflow.dev/docs/)
- Exploring open-source examples to understand best practices
- Experimenting with different node types and dynamic layouts through hands-on trial and error

---

### 2. Conditional Branch Layout
Ensuring consistent and readable branch layouts as users added or renamed branches posed layout issues. I addressed this by:
- Dynamically calculating the X position of each branch node
- Center-aligning branches horizontally based on total branch count

---

### 3. Modular Logic Across Levels
Adding functionality across levels without cluttering earlier stages was important for code clarity. I handled this by:
- Modularizing all custom nodes (`AddButtonNode`, `IfElseNode`, `ActionNode`)
- Using props and data structures to handle all logic types without repeating code
